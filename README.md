# POS Tagging using HMM, Enco-Deco and LLM

### What is POS tagging?
 Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the task of automatically assigning a part-of-speech label (such as noun, verb, adjective, determiner, preposition, etc.) to each word in a text, based on both its definition and its context within a sentence.

This repository analyzes different models each with increasing level of complexity for POS tagging.
